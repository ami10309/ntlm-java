NTLM is NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol. The NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol is used in Microsoft Windows® for
authentication between clients and servers. For Microsoft Windows® 2000 Server operating system, Windows® XP operating system, Windows Server® 2003 operating system, Windows Vista® operating system, and Windows Server® 2008 operating system, Kerberos authentication [MS-KILE] replaces NTLM as the preferred authentication
protocol.

However, NTLM can be used when the Kerberos Protocol Extensions (KILE) do not work, such as in
the following scenarios.
  * One of the machines is not Kerberos-capable.
  * The server is not joined to a domain.
  * The KILE configuration is not set up correctly.
  * The implementation chooses to directly use NLMP.
